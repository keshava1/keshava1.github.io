          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            At Electric Era, I worked on production systems that directly power and manage real-world electric vehicle
            charging infrastructure. My work spanned backend APIs, hardware communication, firmware delivery,
            real-time transaction control, and third-party interoperability.

          <h2>Key Contributions</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Designed and implemented a full <a href="https://evroaming.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/OCPI-2.2.1-d2.pdf">Open Charge Point Interface (OCPI 2.2.1)</a>
              integration, including automated synchronization for site data and charging session status. Built
              caching, diffing, and alerting logic to enforce strong data integrity and reliable interoperability with
              third-party vendors.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
              Developed a complete remote transaction control flow for electric chargers (remote start and stop),
              spanning cloud services down to charger hardware. Enabled third party vendors to reliably initiate sessions with
              real-time status feedback while maintaining reliability under intermittent internet connectivity.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
              Engineered multiple over-the-air firmware update pipelines for different charger boards using serial connections,
              Modbus, and FTP servers. Implemented validation and rollback systems to guarantee safe updates.
              These pipelines were deployed and directly improved system reliability.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
              Integrated payment terminals to support RFID-based charging sessions, enabling drivers to initiate
              charging without a credit card and expanding supported payment workflows.
            </li>
          </ul>
